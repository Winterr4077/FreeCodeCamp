Given a string, return its camel case version using the following rules:

- Words in the string argument are separated by one or more characters from the following set: space ``( )``, dash ``(-)``, or underscore ``(_)``. Treat any sequence of these as a word break.
- The first word should be all lowercase.
- Each subsequent word should start with an uppercase letter, with the rest of it lowercase.
- All spaces and separators should be removed.
